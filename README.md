## 🚀 Project Overview

BuildForIndia is an **Agentic AI-powered travel booking assistant** that intelligently analyzes flights and hotels, simulates dynamic pricing, and recommends the best-value combination based on user preferences.

Unlike traditional booking platforms that overwhelm users with options, this system:

- Understands user intent via conversation  
- Evaluates multiple flight and hotel options  
- Runs dynamic pricing simulation  
- Calculates a value score  
- Recommends the optimal combination  
- Validates with the user before confirmation  

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Travel platforms:

- Show too many options  
- Use surge pricing without transparency  
- Don’t explain why one option is better  

Users struggle to balance:

- Price  
- Comfort  
- Timing  
- Demand fluctuations  

BuildForIndia solves this using **Agentic AI reasoning** and transparent pricing simulation.

## 🤖 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Intent Extraction

The AI extracts:

- Source  
- Destination  
- Travel dates  
- Budget  
- Comfort preference  
- Time preference  

---

### 2️⃣ Multi-Option Retrieval

The system gathers multiple:

- ✈️ Flight options  
- 🏨 Hotel options  

---

### 3️⃣ Dynamic Pricing Simulation

Prices are adjusted based on:

- Demand surge  
- Occupancy level  
- Seasonal factors  
- Competitor pricing simulation  

Example:

| Option    | Base Price | Demand Level | Final Price |
|-----------|------------|--------------|------------|
| Flight A  | ₹6,500     | High         | ₹7,400     |
| Flight B  | ₹6,800     | Low          | ₹6,600     |
| Hotel A   | ₹3,000     | High         | ₹3,600     |
| Hotel B   | ₹2,800     | Medium       | ₹2,950     |

---

### 4️⃣ AI Value Scoring Engine

```

Value Score =
(Price Efficiency × 40%) +
(Comfort Rating × 20%) +
(Time Convenience × 20%) +
(Demand Stability × 20%)

```

The AI selects the best overall combination — not just the cheapest.

---

### 5️⃣ Recommendation + Validation

The assistant presents:

- Recommended flight  
- Recommended hotel  
- Total cost  
- Value score  
- Reason for selection  

User confirms before booking is finalized.
